Mutes Spotify during a hitstop for some extra oomph!

# Building
- Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022
- (Re)Install NAudio through NuGet
- Re-Link the 0Harmony.dll, BepInEx.dll, Assembly-CSharp.dll, UnityEngine.dll, and UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll (I do not know how to properly upload a project to Github, sorry!)
- Build
- Make sure you also put the 3 NAudio DLLs into your BepInEx Plugins, otherwise it won't work.
